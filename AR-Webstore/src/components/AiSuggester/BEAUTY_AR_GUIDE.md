## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Camera Access Denied:**

   - Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Check for browser extensions that might be blocking functionality

3. **Mobile-Specific Issues:**
   - Some mobile browsers have limitations with camera access
   - Try the Banuba hosted version which is optimized for mobile
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection

## Implementation Details

The integration uses several techniques to ensure the best experience across devices:

1. **Responsive Design:**

   - Mobile-specific buttons and options
   - Touch-friendly controls

2. **Device Detection:**
   - User agent detection to identify mobile devices
   - Browser capability detection
   - Conditional rendering based on device type

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Sandbox attributes for iframe security
   - Error handling for iframe loading issues
   - Direct links to hosted versions for guaranteed functionality

## Future Improvements
